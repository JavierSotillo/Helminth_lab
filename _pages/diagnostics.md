# Diagnostics

In alignment with the Instituto de Salud Carlos III main goals, we provide diagnostic resources to the National Health System from Spain. Please, note that we DO NOT offer private tests to individual persons, and all tests should be applied for by your doctor using the appropriate channels provided by the National Health System. The following diagnostic tests are offered by the ISCIII in its service portfolio:
